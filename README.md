# Relation Classification via Attention Model
As you know the attention model can help us to solve many problems.Resently, I have a project which need to recognize the relation from some entities. After reading several paper, I decided to implement this paper: [Relation Classification via Multi-Level Attention CNNs](http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~weblt/papers/relation-classification.pdf)
I desperately desire to use pytorch to do some awsome things. So it's the only choice for me. And i think you will like it.

You need an environment:
pytorch 0.2

Git this project to your pycharm or other IDE, then edit the acnn_train.py to satisfied your data
